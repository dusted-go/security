Release Notes
=============

## 1.3.0

- Changed password policy validation messages to start with capital letter.
- token.Validator will return expiry date as well

## 1.2.0

The `token.Validator` will return more detailed error messages.

## 1.1.0

Should be a major package upgrade but given that it's not publicly used by anyone I'm keeping it on v1.
