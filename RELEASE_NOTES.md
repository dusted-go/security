Release Notes
=============

## 1.2.0

The `token.Validator` will return more detailed error messages.

## 1.1.0

Changed the signature of several functions but not the actual behaviour.

Should be a major package upgrade but given that it's not publicly used by anyone I'm keeping it on v1.

## 1.0.0

Initial release of various packages.
